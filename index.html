     <h2>Favorite Hobbies</h2>
      <P>Some of my favorite hobbies are:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>Red books</li>
        <li>Watch movies or series</li>
        <li>Spending time with family</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Red books</h3>
       <p> One of my favorite hobbies is reading books, the topics that catch my attention the most are those that have to do with mystery and crime; One of my favorite books is "Child 44" it is a book that catches you from the moment you start reading it, the writer describes so well the places, situations and characters, that your head can totally recreate a real movie, and you don't want to stop reading it.

      <h3>Watch movies or series</h3>
       <p>I love watching good movies and series, one of my favorite series is Breaking Bad, from the beginning it is interesting and I could never imagine what was going to happen, usually when I watch a movie or series I can guess what is going to happen next, but with this series the same did not happen, it is simply unpredictable. If you are interested a little more about this serie, you can click <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/" target="_blank"> here</a>. </p>
