      <h3>Red books</h3>
       <p class="hobbies"> One of my favorite hobbies is reading books, the topics that catch my attention the most are those that have to do with mystery and crime; One of my favorite books is "Child 44" it is a book that catches you from the moment you start reading it, the writer describes so well the places, situations and characters, that your head can totally recreate a real movie, and you don't want to stop reading it. If you are interested in knowing a little more about this book, you can click <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2161733.Child_44" target="_blank"> here</a>. </p>

      <h3>Watch movies or series</h3>
       <p class="hobbies">I love watching good movies and series, one of my favorite series is Breaking Bad, from the beginning it is interesting and I could never imagine what was going to happen, usually when I watch a movie or series I can guess what is going to happen next, but with this series the same did not happen, it is simply unpredictable. If you are interested in knowing a little more about this serie, you can click <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/" target="_blank"> here</a>. </p>
